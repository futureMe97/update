When you need/want something/someone you relinquish out your control to an unknown entity, it evaporates out of you, you're not in position of control, if you need/want that it will show it will seek out people can tell and no one wants that, people want the confidence out of us

-What do you want and what kind of person are you looking for with the skills that you seek for x,y,z? what are they dealing, how can i contribute, am i a good fit? what can i do for them, ask questions about their vision and their challenges. 

when you take the attention off your own needs and ego it is more charismatic and appealing to talk to. 

im here to give, something of value
ENTHUSIASM
Have fun in the job interview
