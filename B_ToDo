**COMING UP
=============================================================
If I can only accomplish one thing today it will be:

-“Be still, and know that I am God!” psalm 46:10
-There are moments where, moving is not what we are called to do, we are called to be still and wait for God to show up
-isaiah 40:31
Until God has given us the word, we have to wait until he shows us the next move. 
“Stay right with me”
